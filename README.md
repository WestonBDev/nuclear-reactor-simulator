**RBMK-4 Dynamics**
A physics-based simulation of the Chernobyl Unit 4 RBMK reactor accident.  
Developed in Unity 6 using DOTS, ECS, and Burst-compiled job systems.

The objective is to recreate the simulation presented in the Higgsino Physics video: "[Chernobyl Visually Explained](https://youtu.be/P3oKNE72EzU?si=kIGXqNy9mmr4gZ)"

This project provides an interactive Unity environment in which users may modify various parameters to simulate the power excursion that occurred on April 26, 1986, between 01:23:39 and 01:23:4, including:
• Positive void coefficient feedback  
• Delayed xenon poisoning relief  
• AZ-5 control rod insertion kinetics
