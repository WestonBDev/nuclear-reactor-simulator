# RBMK-4 Dynamics

A physics-based simulation of the Chernobyl Unit 4 RBMK reactor accident.  
Written in Unity 6 with DOTS, ECS, and Burst-compiled job systems for real-time multithreaded performance.

The goal is to reproduce the 26 Apr 1986 power excursion from 01:23:39 to 01:23:45, including:
* positive void coefficient feedback
* delayed xenon poisoning relief
* AZ-5 control-rod insertion kinetics
